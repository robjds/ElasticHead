# ElasticHead
Simscape multibody simulation of a robot crossing an obstacle, with the effect of an elastic neck mass incorporated.

Left and right hand sides of the robot are separately driven by electric motors.
The mass at the head of the robot is connected to the body via a torsion spring.

How to run:
Run 'VariableInitialisation.m' to define the constants/geometry for the simulation
When the simulation (Heads.slx) runs, the script 'ProcessOutput.m' is run.
